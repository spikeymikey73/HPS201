## Statistical Notation

### Notation of Variables

$\Sigma = sum$

$X = variable$

$\bar{X} =$ mean of $X$

### Summation Notation
```{r}
X <- c(45,42,35,23,52)
options(scipen = 999)
knitr::kable(X)
```

$\Sigma X = (X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5) =$ `r sum(X)`

$\Sigma X^2 = (X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2 + X_4^2 + X_5^2) =$ `r  sum(X^2)`

$(\Sigma X)^2 = (X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5)^2 =$ `r  sum(X)^2`

### Double Subscripts

$X_{ij}$ where i = the row and j = the column

>In the above data set:

>3^rd^ trial on day 2

> $X_{2,3} = 13$
>
>4^th^ trial on day 1

>$X_{1,4} = 9$

## Measures of Central Tendency

Once data is collected, research psychologists would usually be interested in examining the <abbr title="the mid-point of a frequency distribution">central tendency</abbr> of this data. 

### The Mode

The mode is he most frequently occurring value and thus represented by the highest bar in a histogram.

### The Median

>‘the score that corresponds to the point at or below which 50% of the scores fall when the data are arranged in numerical order’

A simple rule of thumb formula for finding the **median location** in a set of scores is $(N + 1)/2$ (where $N =$ the number of scores).

### The Mean

-   The most common and popular measure of central tendency is the mean.
-   The mean is simply the average score in a data set and is calculated as:

$$\frac{\Sigma X}{N}$$

### Relative Advantages and Disadvantages of the Mean, Median and Mode
