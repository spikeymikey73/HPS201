3 main types:

-   One Sample: compares a single sample mean to a known population mean
-   Matched Samples: Compares changes in a sample mean across time
-   Independent Samples: Compares two different sample means

#### Overview of the t-test

-   Used for comparing the means of continuous (measurement) data (IQ, height, exam results)
-   Differences between sample means
-   Estimates the Standard Error (difference we expect to see by chance) using sample statistics
-   t-statistic is a ratio of the mean differences obtained and the mean differences expected by chance

$$
  t = \frac{obtained\ mean\ difference}{std\ diff\ expected\ by\ chance}
$$

*Standard Error*

-   The extent to which sample means deviate from the population mean
-   The difference between the population mean and the sample mean we should expect by chance.

Standard error is estimated using the *Central Limit Theorem*:

$$
  = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{pop'n\ sd}{\sqrt{sample\ size}}
$$
*Comparing the sample mean to population mean*

$$
  z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

*This theorem confirms that the larger the sample size, the lower the error*

#### Example {.well}
Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), $\mu = 50, sd = 10$

In a sample of 5 children ($n = 5$) under stress ($M = 56$), is the sample mean different from the population mean?

\begin{align}
H_0: &\mu = 50 \\
H_a: &\mu \ne 50 \\

SE &= \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = 4.47 \\
z &= \frac{56 - 50}{\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}} = \frac{6}{4.47} = 1.34
\end{align}

The probability that we will obtain $z = 1.34$ is $0.0901$. In a two tailed test (estimating the higher and lower parts of the normal distribution) is:

\begin{align}
  0.0901 + 0.0901 = 0.1802
\end{align}

### One Sample t-test {.well}

Compares a single sample mean to a population mean (when we do not know $\sigma$)

#### Example

-   'Impulsiveness' questionnaire (continuous scale from 0 - 18)
-   $\mu = 7.01$
-   Sample of 10 drug users ($n = 10$)
-   Higher levels of impulsiveness is expected in drug users compared to the rest of the population.

#### Hypotheses

\begin{align}
  H_0: \mu = 7.01 \\
  H_a: \mu \ne 7.01 \\
\end{align}

#### Sample Data

```{r echo=FALSE}

X <- c(8.5,12.1,10.0,5.2,15.3,6.2,9.1,10.2,7.9,14.2)
D <- D <- X - mean(X)
variance <- round(D^2, 2)

impulsiveness <- cbind(X,D,variance)

colnames(impulsiveness) <- c("X","X - M","(X - M)^2")

kable(impulsiveness) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

\begin{align}
  s &= \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma(X-\bar{X})^2}{n-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{95}{9}} = 3.25 \\
  t &= \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{9.87 - 7.01}{\frac{3.25}{\sqrt{10}}} = \frac{2.86}{1.03} \\
  &= 2.78(df = 9)
\end{align}

#### Decision Making

-   Calculated t-value = 2.78
-   Critical (from table) t-value = 2.262
