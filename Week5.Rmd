3 main types:

One Sample - compares a single sample mean to a known population mean

Matched Samples - Compares changes in a sample mean across time

Independent Samples - Compares to different sample means

Standard error is estimated using the *Central Limit Theorem*:

$$
  \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

*This theorem confirms that the lower the sample size, the higher the error*

### z-test

$$
  z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
