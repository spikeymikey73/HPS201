### Introduction {.well}

The differences between the t-test and ANOVA:

| t-test                                                       | Example                              | ANOVA                                            | Example                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| One IV: two categorical levels | campus vs. cloud student             | One IV: three or more categorical levels                     | Young vs. Middle Aged vs. Old        |
| One DV: continuous values                                    | IQ score, exam results, unit results | One DV: Continuous values                        | IQ score, exam results, unit results |
| Examines:<br>&nbsp;- between group variance                              | -                                    | Examines:<br>&nbsp;- between group, and<br>&nbsp;-    within group variance | -                                    |

### Assumptions {.well}

-   Homogeneity of Variance: equal spread of each group around the mean
-   Normality: data is characterised by a normal distribution around the mean
-   Independence of Observations: each score is not related to others. If there is a relationship, scores are not random.
-   If these assumptions are violated, caution is required in interpretation of the results.
-   A larger sample size overcomes the violation of assumptions.

### Sources of error {.well}

-   Individual Differences such as sex, gender, personality, measurement error,
-   Variability within group is called error variance,
-   Differences between groups due to chance or effect of treatment

### F-statistic {.well}

Reflects the proportion of variance between groups with the variance within groups.

\begin{align}
  F &= \frac{variance\ between\ groups}{variance\ within\ groups} \\
  OR \\
  F &= \frac{treatment\ effect\ + difference\ due\ to\ chance}{difference\ due\ to\ chance} \\
\end{align}

### Logic of ANOVA {.well}

-   Compares whether the difference between means is greater than the difference expected by chance,
-   Denominator referred to as error variance as it represents uncontrollable/random factors,
-   Numerator difference between mean (can also be due to chance or uncontrollable factors),
-   Numerator also contains differences due to treatment,
-   If numerator treatment effect + error is larger than the denominator, there is evidence that treatment is affecting between group (mean) differences.

### Calculation of ANOVA {.well}

Steps:

1.    Sums of Squares (distance of each score from the mean squared)
2.    Degrees of Freedom
3.    Mean Squares
4.    F-value

#### 1. Sums of Squares (distance of each score from the mean squared)

\begin{align}
  SS_{total} = SS_{treatment} + SS_{error}
\end{align}

##### a. Calculate $SS_{treatment}$
>
>Where:
>
>$\bar{X}_j =$ treatment group mean,
>
>$\bar{X}.. =$ grand mean
>
>\begin{align}
>  SS_{treatment} = n\Sigma(\bar{X}_{j}-\bar{X}..)^2
>\end{align}

>##### b. Calculate $SS_{error}$

>##### c. Calculate $SS_{total}$

#### 2. Degrees of Freedom



#### 3. Mean Squares



#### 4. F-value



### The F statistic {.well}

### ANOVA Summary {.well}

table from slides

### Effect Size {.well}

-   Tells us how much the total variability is caused by the difference between treatments
-   Range from 0 to 1
-   Represented by eta squared ($\eta^2$)
\begin{align}
  \eta^2 = \frac{SS_{treat}}{SS{total}}
\end{align}
