### Introduction {.well}

-   Used to compare means across multiple groups when there is more than one IV (factor) in the analysis:

    -   IV (categorical)
    -   DV (Continuous)

#### One-Way ANOVA (review)

-   Determining how 'happiness' scores (1 - 10) differ based on age (A one-way comparison as there is only one IV)

    -   One IV: Age (3 levels - young, middle, old)
    -   One DV: Happiness

#### Factorial ANOVA

-   Determine differences in 'happiness' based on age AND gender (a two-way comparison as there are two IVs)

    -   Two IVs:

        -   Age: 3 levels (young, middle, old)
        -   Gender:\^2 levels (male, female)

A factorial ANOVA could be used to determine if the effects of age on happiness are the same for males and females.

#### Main & Interaction Effects

With a two-way ANOVA there are three possible effects:

-   Main Effect 1: Overall effect of factor A (ignoring effects of factor B)

-   Main Effect 2: Overall effect of factor B (ignoring effects of factor A)

-   Interaction Effect: where the effect of one factor on the DV is not the same at all levels of the other factor:

    -   Provides information about the relationship between the IVs and DV
    -   Are interpreted best with plots

#### Interaction Example

Two-way ANOVA exploring the effect of temperature on cognitive performance (recall) to determine if the effect is the same for males and females.

-   IV1: Temperature (3 levels: 10$^\circ$, 20$^\circ$, 30$^\circ$)
-   IV2: Gender (2 levels: male and female)
-   DV: Performance (recall)

!Insert graph from handout!

#### Interactions

-   For females, performance improves with temperature
-   For males, temperature has no effect
-   The effect of IV1 (temperature) is not the same at all levels of IV2 (gender)
-   If the plot lines are parallel (do not cross over), there is no interaction

#### Main Effects

!Insert graph 2 from notes

-   A main effect is the effect of IV1 on the DV (overall effect of temperature on cognitive performance), while ignoring the effects of IV2.
-   A main effect is the effect of IV2 on the DV (overall effect of gender on cognitive performance), while ignoring the effects of IV1.
-   Each IV can have a main effect of DV and an individual effect on DV.

#### Steps

-   $n =$ number of participants in each cell (e.g. males with low anxiety = 3, there are 3 participants in every cell),
-   $a =$ levels of factor A
-   $b =$ levels of factor B

##### Calculate $SS_{total}$

\begin{align}
  SS_{total} &= \Sigma(X-\bar{X}..)^2 \\
  &= (6 – 7.33)^2 + (7 – 7.33)^2 + (9 –7.33)^2 + (8 – 7.33)^2 + (8 – 7.33)^2 + \\
    &   (7 – 7.33)^2 + (4 – 7.33)^2 + (10 – 7.33)^2 + (5 – 7.33)^2 + (9 – 7.33)^2 + \\
    &   (6 – 7.33)^2 + (9 – 7.33)^2 \\
  &=  1.7689 + 0.1089 + 2.7889 + 0.4489 + 0.4489 + 0.1089 + 11.0889 \\
    &   + 7.1289 + 5.4289 + 2.7889 + 1.7689 + 2.7889 \\
  &=  36.667
\end{align}

##### Calculate $SS_A$

\begin{align}
  SS_{A} &= nb\Sigma(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}..)^2 \\
  &= 3 \times 2[(7.5 - 7.33)^2 + (7.16 - 7.33)^2] \\
  &= 6 \times 0.0578 \\
  &= 0.34 \\
\end{align}

##### Calculate $SS_B$

\begin{align}
  SS_{B} &= na\Sigma(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}..)^2 \\
  &= 3 \times 2[(6.33 - 7.33)^2 + (8.33 - 7.33)^2] \\
  &= 6 \times 2 \\
  &= 12 \\
\end{align}

##### Calculate $SS_{cells}$

\begin{align}
  SS_{cells} &= n\Sigma(\bar{X}_A - \bar{X}..)^2 \\
  &= 3 \times [(7.67 - 7.33)^2 + (7.33 - 7.33)^2 + (5 - 7.33)^2 + (9.33 - 7.33)^2] \\
  &= 3 \times 9.5445 \\
  &= 28.6335
\end{align}

##### Calculate $SS_{A*B}$

\begin{align}
  SS_{AB} &= SS_{cells} – SS_A – SS_B \\
  &= 28.6335 – 0.34 – 12 \\
  &= 16.3
\end{align}

##### Calculate $SS_{error}$

\begin{align}
  SS_{error} &= SS_{total} – SS_{cells} \\
  &= 36.667 – 28.6335 \\
  &= 8
\end{align}
