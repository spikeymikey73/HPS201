### Introduction {.well}

-   Used to compare means across multiple groups when there is more than one IV (factor) in the analysis:
    -   IV (categorical)
    -   DV (Continuous)
    
#### One-Way ANOVA (review)

- Determining how 'happiness' scores (1 - 10) differ based on age (A one-way comparison as there is only one IV)
    -   One IV: Age (3 levels - young, middle, old)
    -   One DV: Happiness
    
#### Factorial ANOVA

-   Determine differences in 'happiness' based on age AND gender (a two-way comparison as there are two IVs)
    -   Two IVs:
        -   Age: 3 levels (young, middle, old)
        -   Gender: 2 levels (male, female)

A factorial ANOVA could be used to determine if the effects of age on happiness are the same for males and females.

#### Main & Interaction Effects

With a two-way ANOVA there are three possible effects:

-   Main Effect 1: Overall effect of factor A (ignoring effects of factor B)
-   Main Effect 2: Overall effect of factor B (ignoring effects of factor A)
-   Interaction Effect: where the effect of one factor on the DV is not the same at all levels of the other factor:
    -   Provides information about the relationship between the IVs and DV
    -   Are interpreted best with plots
    
#### Interaction Example

Two-way ANOVA exploring the effect of temperature on cognitive performance (recall) to determine if the effect is the same for males and females.

-   IV1: Temperature (3 levels: 10$\degrees$, 20$\degrees$, 30$\degrees$)
-   IV2: Gender (2 levels: male and female)
-   DV: Performance (recall)

!Insert graph from handout!

#### Interactions

-   For females, performance improves with temperature
-   For males, temperature has no effect
-   The effect of IV1 (temperature) is not the same at all levels of IV2 (gender)
-   If the plot lines are parallel (do not cross over), there is no interaction

#### Main Effects

!Insert graph 2 from notes

-   A main effect is the effect of IV1 on the DV (overall effect of temperature on cognitive performance), while ignoring the effects of IV2.
-   A main effect is the effect of IV2 on the DV (overall effect of gender on cognitive performance), while ignoring the effects of IV1.
-   Each IV can have a main effect of DV and an individual effect on DV.
